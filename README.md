# Recaman-visualizer
Simple. It visualizes the Recaman sequence which goes like this:
you have a number i which increases by 1 each iteration starting at 1
If the space on a number line i spaces back behind you is not 0 or negative and has not been crossed before move backwards to that position, otherwise move forwards i spaces
To visualize it you draw a semicircle between the two points you are moving between
